# ultra sound money: optimistic relay

The default branch of this repo, called `prod-optimistic-relaying` is the modification of https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay to enable optimistic relaying 
for the ultra sound [relay](relay.ultrasound.money). 

We have also opened a PR with the same set of changes on the main repo https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/pull/285 to increase visibility and continue the discussion of upstreaming this change.
